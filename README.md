# CSCI3916_HW2


To the grader:

I am sorry, but I cannot get the postman share collection to work properly without pulling in tons of junk deleted collections as well. If you download this repo, there are 2 versions of postman importable json files you can use in the root directory. A postman collection titled CSCI3916_HW2_INNKEEPER77 with 10 different requests is what you should see upon a successful import to postman. Thank you!
